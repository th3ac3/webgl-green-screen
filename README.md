## Credit:

The starting code for this was example 8.
I used code from Mozilla's WebGL tutorial series to use videos as textures
I used code from http://learningwebgl.com to help aid in creating everything.
I was inspired by various shaders on https://www.shadertoy.com/ for my shaders.

## Time Spent: ~30 hours. 

Much of this time was spent understanding learning about green screen compositing,
and learning more about WebGL.
